## 1. Atmosphere

It is important to develop a special atmosphere  
to hold the whole process

### Examples of Purpose

- To free the client from GHOST.
	- Clients may become possessed by the voices of someone else.
- To create an atmosphere that the client feels safe and the therapist supportive.
	- The client feels punitive towards himself and sees even the therapist as potentially threatening.
- To free the client from altered state of consciousness.
- To create an atmosphere that allows the client to have some distance from the experiences.
	- If a client is in panic (altered states of consciousness) and hard to concentrate.

### Points

Maintain perspective.

- Metaskills
- Sometimes stepping backward
- Sometimes having time and space

> Note: Subtle things may be crucial, even you never done consciously or remember it, though.

## 2. Framework

It is important to develop framework within which to work  
to safely process to the secondary one.

### Frame and Framework as described in this chapter:

| Term | Nuance | Definition, Meaning |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------ |
| frame | Physical, object-oriented | A rigid structure that surrounds the secondary process |
| framework | Policy/methodology-oriented | Systematic operational policy to process secondary one |

Frame's functions:

1. hold onto what has occurred
2. make a space for what has occurred
3. appreciate what has occurred

so that ... :

- ask the client to explore what happened cautiously (in slow motion, for instance)
- the client to notice subtle feelings that arise in connection with what happened

### Creating a framework

Frameworks could be created spontaneously, depending on the therapist's style and the atmosphere.

#### Clues to creating one:

- Talk to primary process about secondary:
	- Now that occurs, so how you feel?
- Ghost stories:
	- What rore each of us in? Then step out from the role.
- Dream maps:
	- Check overall pattern of a dream.

#### Ideas:

- In a timely manner (for only 2 minutes, for instance)
- The therapist act out as the client did and give him/her chance to observe it
- Treat the conflict between the client and the therapist (perhaps as the client's defense)
	- so that the client can handle the situation and be conscious of what is happening
	- think about the situation together

#### An example (step by step):

1. A conflict arose between the therapist and the client.
2. The client said "doesn't want anyone in his space."
3. The therapist first showed respect for the client's needs.
4. Then proposed that she move toward the client little by little and check his feelings out.

#### Points for the example:

1. The client had full leadership and direction over the conflict situation
2. Set a framework to make him CONSCIOUSLY involved

## Overall

1. Client's safety
	- Developing framework within which the therapy safely processes.
2. Client's consciousness
	- Client him/herself can handle the situation.
3. Metaskills/Meta communications
	- Create framework flexibly with the flow of the process.
